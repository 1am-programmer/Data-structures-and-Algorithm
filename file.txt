FACTORIALS are basically n(n-1)(n-2) repeated until you reach the number 1

-If n! is 3!, it means 3 X 2 X 1 = 6
-Which is the number of combination we got for three cities
-If n! is 4!, it means 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 = 24
-Which is the number of combination we got for four cities
-In solving the Traveling Salesman problem, the most efficient algorithm
will have a factorial/ combination runtime or combination runtime And in
a situation where it is 200!, it was a longer time to solve

Studying exponential algorithms are useful for two reasons
    1. In studying how to make such algorithms efficient, we develop
    strategies that are useful across the board and can be used to make
    existing algorithms even more efficient

    2. It is important to be aware of problems that take a long time to
    solve, knowing the problem is somewhat unsolveable in a realistic
    time, so you can focus your attention to other aspects of the problem
